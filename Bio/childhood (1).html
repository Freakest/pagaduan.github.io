            <p> <blockquote>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share a story from my childhood.1 I came from a happy and healthy family.2 As the youngest of five children (two sisters and two brothers), I was blessed to have them.3 They taught me everything important in life.4 I grew up in a place where street games were popular.5 Cell phones weren't common yet, so we enjoyed a childhood filled with real-life experiences.6 So masaya akong nakikilala ang aking mga kababata at classmates na silang naging kaaway at kaibigan ko.7 There were times when friendships started with titigan, angasan, sigaan na syang nag dudulot ng malaking pag aaway.8 But as time passed, we'd eventually become playmates and friends.9 Some might see this as a negative part of childhood, but I think it's just another story to tell.10 The world is full of cruel and rude people, and you need to know how to stand up for yourself.11 I was bullied from kindergarten until first grade.12 Then, I met many friends in school who helped me overcome the bullies.13 We played plenty of street games like tumbang preso, luksong baka, piko, paway, patintero, and many more that were so much fun.14 My mother would always shout my name para umuwi at maligo dahil sa dami ng pawis na nakuha ko sa pag lalaro.15 The same went for school, I was always busy joining events and games, which sometimes made me sick.16 When I turned nine, these games were still popular, but kids were also getting into dancing.17 I was fascinated and impressed.18 The dance was called "Jerk," or some people called it "Harlem Shake."19 It's a really cool dance where you should be creative for a footstep or hand signs.20 I remember I joined the group DP performed and got in, but because of study I cannot join meetings and gatherings, so I left.21 Around the age of ten or eleven, I discovered new games on the computer: Crossfire, League of Legends, Rules of Survival, Left 4 Dead, and many more.22 I spent more than 40 pesos a day just to play computer games at the internet cafe.23 I play games with my kababata but sometimes with new people who were more challenging.24 Every day, I played for more than three and a half hours, but it came with a condition.25 After I play, I need to go to sleep.26 It is because I get what I want, and dapat sumunod ako kay mama.27 One day, my mother was so angry because I'd been at the computer shop for too long.28 She complained that I wasn't home because I stayed at the computer shop for eight hours.29 I understood her and just followed her wishes.30 Ilang estudyante ako ay masayang nag-aaral.31 Even though I had a hard time understanding the lessons, I tried my best to keep up so I wouldn't be left behind.32 As a child of my parents, I was a good kid who always kept my promise to help them with chores.33 Ang saya lang alalahanin ang mga memories na kinalakihan ko.34 Life is completely different.35 Yung ibang kababata ko ay merong nang pamilya, trabaho, o kanya-kanyang diskarte, di tulad ng dati na masayang naglalaro, walang problema, na ang tanging problema ay anong lalaruin at anong kakainin bilang meryenda.36 I'm really happy to share my childhood memory.37 It was really full of joy and smiles, and I wonder if I can ever go back to the past.38<sup><b>20</b></sup> <br></br>
