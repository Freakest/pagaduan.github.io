                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My college experience has been fun so far, I think.1 Back in elementary and high school, I only attended public schools.2 Starting at a private school for the first time, I didn't know how to interact and felt mixed emotions. 3 Happiness, excitement, and especially nervousness since I didn't have any friends.4 New school, new faces, new professors definitely new missions.5 In my first year as a college student, I felt lost regarding my subjects.6 Our former professor in UE Comprog 1 wasn't very good at teaching.7 When I met my classmates and we became friends, I asked them about the subject, and they helped me a lot, even tutoring me.8 I can't really compare how difficult college is compared to high school.9 If you were relaxed before, college is different; you need to be attentive and active academically.10 I would say that tuition is a waste of money if you don't take college seriously.11 Even I struggle with exams, but I'm still trying to survive. 12 You can feel the struggle in college, the last-minute cramming because of early deadlines, the commute to school, the loss of sleep, and much more.13 But somehow, I feel relief. 14 There are only a few more semesters to finish before I graduate and finally start working.15 I know working is hard, but thatâ€™s the reality we need to face.16 If I ever feel pressure, I will consider it a studying technique.17 My college experience has been enjoyable thus far.18 I am happy with how my college journey is progressing.19 I am grateful for the positive experiences I have had in college so far.20<sup><b>20</b></sup><br><br>
