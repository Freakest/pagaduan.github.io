                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teenage Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's revisit my teenage years.1 As a teen, I explored various interests, from writing, tagging, and graffiti, electrical-related and many more.2 I also tried out badminton, futsal, and even ML tournaments, and joined organizations like the robotics and electrical teams in high school.3 It all began in 7th grade.4 My cousins, who were in the TVE program, told me how fun the electricity subject was, so I decided to give it a try, and I ended up really enjoying it.5 Early in 7th grade, I was quite introverted, making only four friends the entire year.6 However, I did meet a gorgeous, smart, strong, and independent girl.7 At the end of the school year, when all the books were being returned, I saw her in line.8 She glanced at me, smiled, and I decided to take a chance.9 I walked right up to her and said, "Hello, you're beautiful!" and introduced myself.10 She simply turned and walked away.11 I was crushed.12 I figured I wasn't her type.13 When 8th grade started, I found her on Facebook, added her as a friend, and messaged her, explaining that I didn't mean to scare her.14 She replied, and we started talking.15 That year, I had a great group of friends.16 Our class had 50 students, 42 boys and only 8 girls so it was a tight-knit group.17 I loved the electricity classes because my classmates and I worked together to solve problems.18 My family and friends were also a huge support system during high school.19 Sometime during the second grading period of 8th grade, that girl I had met became my girlfriend.20 I was so happy, and we're still together today.21 After 8th and 9th grade came 10th grade, which was completely different because of the COVID-19 pandemic.22 Many schools switched to online learning.23 COVID-19 cases were high in our area (Pembo, Makati, Taguig), and our old elementary school even became a quarantine facility.24<sup><b>20</b></sup><br></br>
